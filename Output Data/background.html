<p>The City of Paramount is home to nearly 56,000 residents, primarily Latinx, low-income families, and has played host to metal manufacturing businesses since the early 20th century. There are over <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=15uOx9_VDszGkcH0r-2_BZo6Hky_1L_A&amp;usp=sharing">141 metal-related facilities</a> in the city, many of which release toxic chemicals into the surrounding community. One of those chemicals is toxic hexavalent chromium (also known as chromium VI and commonly shortened to hex chrome), and their activities expose people primarily through hex chrome mists and dust from chromium plating and metal grinding. Hex chrome is a highly dangerous cancer-causing chemical that is mostly human made. It is also known to cause birth defects and reproductive harm, as well as damage to the kidneys, lungs, eyes, skin, liver and respiratory system.</p>

<p>In 2016, the <a href = "http://www.aqmd.gov/nav/about/">South Coast Air Quality Management District</a> (the local government agency responsible for regulating air quality) began extensive hex chrome air monitoring after years of community activism requesting they do so. They found hex chrome levels in the City of Paramount up to 350 times higher than average background levels in the surrounding areas and broader region. Since then, companies releasing hex chrome into the air have faced pressure to change their business practices to reduce their emissions of hex chrome. However, companies continue releasing hex chrome at levels that are problematic for the health of people breathing the air on a daily basis. (Remember to watch the video to learn more about the US Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Threshold Limit.)</p>

<p>Paramount activists and leaders continue to advocate that companies reduce their emissions of this cancer-causing chemical and that government agencies put in place the proper regulations to protect the health of the community and the environment.</p>

<h3>Community-led Air Monitoring for Hexavalent Chromium</h3>

<p>A group of community members, with support from the Center for Environmental Health, set up a community-led monitoring project to measure the levels of hex chrome at locations chosen by the people most impacted – those living and working in Paramount. The graph of the data (found in the Data tab) comes from the two monitors that are a part of this project. </p>

<h3>Interpreting the Monitoring Data</h3>

<p>The monitors sample the air every 3 three days, at which point the samples are collected and shipped to a laboratory for analysis. This means that the lines connecting the data points in the graph only reflect the trend of the data points and not the levels of hex chrome during days that air samples were not collected.</p>

<p>The amount of hex chrome that someone may be exposed to will depend on the levels of hex chrome in the air, how close someone is to the polluting facilities, how long they breathe the polluted air, weather conditions, and other factors.</p>
